## üê∏ About Me

Hey there! I‚Äôm Sijan, a Ph.D. candidate in Industrial-Organizational Psychology with a concentration in Data Science at Montclair State University. In other words, I‚Äôm passionate about people, data, and making workplaces better for everyone.

#### üß† My Research

I blend psychology with cutting-edge data science techniques to create psychometrically valid, reliable assessment tools. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs), I design psychometrically robust tools to predict key organizational metrics like job satisfaction, engagement, and turnover. My most recent work focuses on examining the validity, predictive bias, and risk of adverse impact of AI-based assessment tools and scoring systems. I also explore topics like team decision-making, delay discounting, and biases and heuristics.

#### üß© Beyond the Academia

When I‚Äôm not diving into data or teaching statistics as an adjunct professor, I‚Äôm leading initiatives and workshops for METRO, SIO NYC, and Eagle I/O, empowering I/O students and professionals. I‚Äôve also worked with organizations like JUST Capital and City Bank, helping them make data-driven decisions to enhance their workforce strategies.
