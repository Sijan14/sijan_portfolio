Hi there! I'm Sijan (Yess! I go by my last name-I will tell you the story someday!). Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in Industrial-Organizational Psychology with a concentration in Data Science. I also teach undergraduate statistics and have a passion for discussing topics like assessment development, fairness, validity, psychometrics, data visualization, natural language processing (NLP), and artificial intelligence (AI). Poke around my website to learn more!
